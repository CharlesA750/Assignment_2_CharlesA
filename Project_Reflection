- Approximately 25-30 hours. Including planning, making
  the program, asking for help and the reflection

2. What are you most satisfied with?
- GUI layout. the functionality of it not as much but I felt
  I was able to make the layout the way I wanted to without too much difficulty.

3. What are you least satisfied with?
- Functionality of classes interacting with GUI. This was an area I really
  struggled with and still couldn't get it to work 100%

4. What worked well in your development process?
- The kivy file. I felt like creating the kivy file was the best bit and if
  something was wrong with the layout then it didnt take much to fix it.

5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
- Start earlier and ask more questions
- Focus on the more relevant areas and less on fiddly stuff. Only try to
  make it perfect once the program runs

6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
- Asking tutor for help when needed.
- Watching lectures and doing tutorials

7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
- The main challenge for me was classes, I overcame them by watching lectures
  and tutorials and asking people for help.

8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
- Classes will help my code as I continue to use them. Right now they make
  things confusing for me but I see that they are important and will improve
  my code and allow me to do things i couldn't without them
